# DataComp Cluster Quality Classifier for CLIP Model Training

Classify image-text clusters as either "High Value" or "Low Value" for training high-quality CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models. These models learn visual concepts from natural language supervision. Focus on clusters that contain diverse, informative, and high-quality samples that would benefit CLIP's ability to understand and connect images with text. Avoid clusters with repetitive, low-quality, or potentially harmful content.

## Examples

### Example 1
Cluster data:
  "closest_samples": [
    "Detailed landscape photography of mountains",
    "Close-up of a rare flower species",
    "Historic architecture in European cities",
    "Portrait of a person from an indigenous culture",
    "Microscopic image of a unique cellular structure"
  ]
  "furthest_samples": [
  ]
Reason: Diverse, informative content with high-quality imagery and educational value. Good for training CLIP on a variety of subjects and scales.
Classification: High Value

### Example 2
Cluster data:
  "closest_samples": [
    "IMG_001.jpg",
    "IMG_002.jpg",
    "IMG_003.jpg",
    "IMG_004.jpg",
    "IMG_005.jpg"
  ]
Reason: Generic filenames without descriptive content, likely low-quality or repetitive images. Provides no useful text-image pairs for CLIP training.
Classification: Low Value

### Example 3
Cluster data:
  "closest_samples": [
    "Cute cat video #243",
    "Funny dog compilation part 56",
    "Top 10 pet fails",
    "Adorable kitten playing with yarn",
    "Puppy learns to howl"
  ]
Reason: Repetitive content focused on a narrow topic (pet videos) without significant educational or diverse informational value. Limited usefulness for broad CLIP understanding.
Classification: Low Value

### Example 4
Cluster data:
  "closest_samples": [
    "Quantum computing explained",
    "Renewable energy technologies comparison",
    "Ancient civilization archaeological discoveries",
    "Cutting-edge medical research findings",
    "Innovative sustainable architecture designs"
  ]
Reason: Diverse, informative content covering various fields of science, technology, and culture with educational value. Excellent for training CLIP on complex concepts and their visual representations.
Classification: High Value

### Example 5
Cluster data:
  "closest_samples": [
    "Professional portrait of a CEO",
    "Infographic on global economic trends",
    "3D render of a futuristic city",
    "Detailed technical diagram of a new invention",
    "High-resolution satellite image of deforestation"
  ]
Reason: Diverse content with professional imagery, informative graphics, and subjects relevant to business, technology, and environmental issues. Good variety for CLIP to learn different types of visual-textual associations.
Classification: High Value
