![tiniest 1% logo](./tinier_logo.png)

This is the about page from my website.

I wanted to use my logo, but in a bit more creative way.
So I decided to train a tiny nn on my logo and display in
real time the process. This is a super cool effect.
Kudos to i dont remember who that tought me that.

Steps: 

1. Pass the entire logo to single bits and bites. 
This is pretty simple I only have to grab the image and the x and y positions
are going to be what the model learns.

2. Generate a pretty shallow model to train and generate
  the image. I actually want to overfit a little bit. To
  show it cool.

3. Show the training steps over time.

NOTE: THIS IS WIP.
